# League Auto
A program to automate league of legends client tasks such as auto accepting queue and calling role/locking in champ for blind pick.

To run the script, download the repo and run the .exe named `league-auto`. Keep everything in the folder as is.

Upon running the executable, a prompt like this should show up.

Here, you enter the desired role you want, this is what will be typed when in champ select. After entering the role and pressing enter, a message like this should appear.

Now the script is running. Once you enter the queue, it will automatically accept the queue and once in champ select, will guarantee you get the role entered. Afterwards, the prompt will close indicating the script has exited.
